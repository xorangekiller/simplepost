SimplePost is an extremely lightweight Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
server based on GNU libmicrohttpd. It is missing many of the features of more
established web servers such as Apache, Nginx, and Lighttpd. SimplePost has no
intention of competing with these more established projects on features or
speed. Its goal is to be a highly portable, fast, and low-resource web server
for quickly transferring files from one computer to another on the same network
with minimal setup.

The server is HTTP/1.1 compilant, but it does not implement the entire
specification. Since SimplePost is only intended to be a simple file server, it
handles that use case well. However, it has no support for user authentication,
CGI scripting, plugins, and other advanced features of modern web servers.
Unimplemented features are handled gracefully by sending the client a
'501 Method Not Implemented' error message, as mandated by the standard.
