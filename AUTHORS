J. David Blackstone wrote a program called tinyhttpd in 1990 for a networking
class and posted it on SourceForge. The first two versions of this program,
SimplePost 0.1 and SimplePost 0.2.x, were based on his tinyhttpd 0.1.0 HTTP
server code, which was the first and only tinyhttpd release.

Karl Lenz modified tinyhttpd in 2012 to create the first version of SimplePost.
It was just a simple hack, which was intended to be single-use, to serve a file
over HTTP once. Once the first version was working, Karl found more uses for it
and decided to add new front-end features and make the program more reliable.
Although SimplePost 0.2.x was much more robust, its HTTP standards support was
severely lacking. Therefore in early 2014 Karl decided to refactor the program
and improve HTTP/1.1 support. This morphed into SimplePost 0.3.0, which
constituted a rewrite in C and complete replacement of J. David Blackstone's
HTTP server code with GNU libmicrohttpd.
